A city in the sky is a castle high above the clouds. 
The top of the castle overlooks the sea. But after bacar's reign, 
there was no sign of the sky city. 
It was not until the fire at grantham weakened the magic surrounding it that the sky city was finally seen again.
At that time, there were more rumors about the celestial world than stars, 
but no one could prove its existence.
This continued until kelli, the sharpshooter, 
fell from the sky, and the existence of the celestial realm was confirmed by kelli's description.
Many adventurers had tried to reach the celestial realm, but later they found that all access to it was blocked. 
Rumor has it that this is a barrier placed by the dragon king bacar to prevent communication between heaven and arad.
It's full of dragons, but the good news is you can handle it. After all the hard fighting, you've successfully saved The Castle in The Sky.
