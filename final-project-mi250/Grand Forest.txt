'Grange' in elvish means 'flowing forest'. The elves' home is at the very center of the three empires. 
When the elves lost faith in humans, most of them left. 
But it is said that a small portion of the grantham remains. 
According to those who have stumbled into the area, the forest is home to flowers and ancient treasures.
The harbinger of the end of the world began in this forest. 
The animals and plants in the forest became angry and many people lost their lives there. But this was only the beginning, 
for there were rumors in the world of horrible monsters in the forest, 
and panic ensued that eventually ignited the fires of gongrange.
Since then, the few remaining elves have disappeared here, 
and the forest is ruled by a wild herd of animals and plants. What happened in the forest?
It is full of giblins, but the good news is you can handle it. After all the hard fighting, you have successfully saved the Grand Forest.
