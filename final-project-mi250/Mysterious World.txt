For thousands of years, humans have called the mysterious and frightening alien world hell. 
But with common sense, I knew that place could not be understood with real-world concepts of time and space. 
Two hundred years ago, we dark elves discovered the diachronic crack and secretly studied it. 
In addition to the new understanding of the alien structure, 
we also found that the alien world is full of an infinite power... If we can harness this power, 
we dark elves will have extraordinary powers. But it's so powerful that I'm afraid we won't even have a chance to touch it. 
At the same time, I was full of questions about such a place, wondering whether it was there because of god's permission. 
If it is not the permission of god, then who is this infinite realm secretly revealed to us? - the journal of metamorphoses of dark elf alchemist sandu, arad 690.
