Originally a prosperous place to the north of 'herton-mar', just as the war with the dark elves was about to start, 
Northmyre was attacked by an infectious disease similar to the dark elf town for no reason.
All the people died in the town, which had become a ghost city. The duchy sent a number of investigators, 
but none survived. Rumor has it that the place has been taken over by a rabid band of thieves. 
The empire's top brass thought that northrop grumman had vital intelligence, 
but now no one dared go near it. 'Boken' was summoned to call in veteran adventurers to find out.
